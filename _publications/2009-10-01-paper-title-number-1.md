Abstract: We provide new evidence of worker–firm matching based on preferences, attitudes and personality traits using new, representative matched employer–employee data from Germany. Time-constant firm characteristics explain a significant proportion of total variance in a series of outcome variables commonly applied in behavioral economics research. Hence, behavioral characteristics play an important, yet under researched, role in the labor market matching process.
