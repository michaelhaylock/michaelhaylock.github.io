01.10.2019	The role of preferences, attitudes, and personality traits in labor market matching	Economics Letters	We provide new evidence of worker–firm matching based on preferences, attitudes and personality traits using new, representative matched employer–employee data from Germany. Time-constant firm characteristics explain a significant proportion of total variance in a series of outcome variables commonly applied in behavioral economics research. Hence, behavioral characteristics play an important, yet under researched, role in the labor market matching process.		Sorting-letter	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2019.108718

Past research shows that executives’ pay is determined by short-term stock performance to a substantial degree. This paper tests for distributional differences in the time horizon of the performance–pay relation, controlling for executive-firm fixed effects in a quantile regression framework. I identify short-term and long-term firm and industry performance using a filter and estimate distributional differences in the short-term and long-term performance–pay relation using method of moments–quantile regression (Machado and Santos Silva in J Econ 213:145–173, 2019). I find the right tail of the conditional total compensation distribution has a more long-term-oriented performance–pay relation than the left tail. By contrast, the right tail of the conditional accumulated wealth distribution has more short-term-oriented performance–pay relation than the left tail. Results show that asymmetry in short-term firm performance–pay relations may exist, but do not vary across the conditional distribution.		compensation	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00181-021-02042-2
